# NLP Applications and Google Translate Project

This project includes two PDF files. The first file contains a categorization of NLP applications for different use cases, while the second file discusses the innovative technology of Google Translate and its application in machine translation. These documents were completed as part of a Data Science bootcamp coursework.

   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd finalCapstone
   ```

3. You can now access the PDF files (`NLP_Applications.pdf` and `Google_Translate_Project.pdf`) using any PDF viewer.

Remember to replace "CKKN303" with your own GitHub username if you want to clone the repository under your account.

Note: If you already have the repository cloned, make sure to fetch the latest changes from the remote repository using `git pull` before navigating to the project directory.

## Usage

Once you have installed the project, you can use the PDF files for reference or study. Here are the suggested ways to utilize them:

1. **NLP Applications**:
   - Open the `NLP_Applications.pdf` file to explore different use cases and their corresponding NLP application categorizations.
   - Use the information to understand how NLP is applied in scenarios such as email allocation, essay grading, and assisting doctors in providing diagnoses.

2. **Google Translate Project**:
   - Open the `Google_Translate_Project.pdf` file to learn about the innovative technology behind Google Translate.
   - Gain insights into how Google Translate achieves language translation using Neural Machine Translation and advanced techniques like Recurrent Neural Networks and Encoder-Decoder Architecture.
   - Understand the applications and limitations of machine translation and its significance in bridging language barriers.
